data
====
    mc corrections
    ----
    [ ] work out a scheme for storing these weights in a dataframe or something
    [ ] pid calib
        [ ] create histograms (partly done)
        [ ] add weights column to dataframes
    [ ] D momentum
        [ ] create plot
        [ ] add weights column to dataframes
    [ ] eta
        [ ] create plot
        [ ] add weights column to dataframes

    the other years
    ----
    [x] 2018 MagDown
    [x] 2018 MagUp
    [x] 2017 MagDown
    [x] 2017 MagUp
    [x] 2016 MagDown
    [x] 2016 MagUp
    [ ] whatever else

    [ ] sensibly deal with K+ and K-

    cuts
    ----
    [ ] decide if we should remove candidates at random; atm i just pick the first

bdt cut
====
    systematics
    ----
    [ ] work out how to do it
    [ ] do it

    [x] see if secondaries really are removed by BDT cut
        - [x] turn the value of the BDT cut up - see what happens to secondaries
        - looks good enough for now; should do a full study with 11166001 in future but we can do that later (i.e. never)

efficiency
====
    implementation
    ----
    [ ] Make it smoother
        - [ ] try with more trees
        - [ ] compare it to time-only
    [ ] Make the low time cutoff value consistent everywhere
    [ ] Implement absolute efficiency scaling
    [x] Normalise weights correctly
        - instead of normalising a chunk at a time, should somehow normalise them overall
    [ ] Get some evidence that the WS and RS efficiencies are different
        - double misID rate study from MC (without cuts)... should show that they're different...
          though I tried this during the group meeting and it didn't seem to show any double misIDs

    systematic
    ----
    [ ] work out how to assign a systematic
        - maybe compare efficiencies from MC and pgun?
    [ ] do it

    simulation
    ----
    [ ] fix the scaling
    [ ] do a study where we correct for an efficiency after introducing some mixing


mass fit
====
    implementation
    ----
    [ ] decide if it is now working
    [ ] check that I get the right signal fraction out of it
    [ ] plot the sqrt bkg fit alongside the alt bkg fit

    systematic
    ----
    [ ] work out how to assign a systematic
    [ ] do it maybe

charm fit
====
    BES-CLEO combination
    ----
    [ ] find out whether the CLEO params are right
    [ ] address it - either remove CLEO or use the right param
    [ ] find out whether the BES params are right (i think they are)

    Other stuff
    ----
    [ ] update x, y constraints to the latest version
    [ ] decide if we need a simultaneous fitter across bins
    [ ] add a fifth phase space bin for the ks veto
